## Currency converter

This is a currency converter application. We are using API's from european central bank. This app gives accurate information of the current exchange rates. I have build this app in 1-2 days. This is my side/pet project.

### How to run it ?

We have two folders. (I am still working on docker file to work it properly until then do it manually)

- install dependencies backend `cd backend`

  - `npm i` or `yarn`
  - for running test `yarn test`
  - for development mode`yarn dev`
  - for building `yarn build`
  - for running on prod mode `yarn start`
  - default port is - http://localhost:8080/
